# Node.js Azure Function for generating SAS tokens

This is a sample HTTP trigger Azure Function that returns consumption cost per subscription.

## Deploy to Azure

The automated deployment provisions an Azure Storage account and an Azure Function in a Dynamic compute plan and sets up deployment from source control. 

The deployment template has a parameter `manualIntegration` which controls whether or not a deployment trigger is registered with GitHub. Use `true` if you are deploying from the main Azure-Samples repo (does not register hook), `false` otherwise (registers hook). Since a value of `false` registers the deployment hook with GitHub, deployment will fail if you don't have write permissions to the repo.

## How it works



If the function will be called from a mobile client or a JavaScript web app, we recommend that you add authentication to your Function using [App Service Authentication/Authorization](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-authentication-overview/). The API key is usually insufficent for security purposes since it can be discovered by sniffing traffic or decompiling the client app.
